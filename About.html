      <p>My name is James Kalunga, i am originaly from central Africa, D.R.Congo.My familly and i were resetled as refugees in Tucson Arizona on the 14th of December 2007, where i had a chance to attend high school for two years and graduated. After high school i was granted a scholarship at GCU in Phoenix where i did my undergad in International Relations. After, i decided to go and give back to my fellow refugees by working with a refugee resettlment agency.I worked for aproximately five years.As years went by i started to feel bored of living in AZ, especially summer was extremely hot for me. My wife and i decided to relocate to Georgia in october 2018 and now here i am.</p>
      <ol><li>As child growing up in the D.R. Congo i did not have access to computers until when my family and i flew to Uganda. I remember my first time touching a computer was when i escorted my friend to  internet cafe.</li>
      <li>After the day i escorted my friend at the the internet cafe. </li>
      <li>I remember going back home and told my dad that i was interested in learning how to use computers but it would require money to learn.</li>
      <li>A few days after talking to my dad about computer lessons, he went to talk some other people and reffered my brothers and i to an offordable computer class.</li>
      <li>While i was enrolled in basic computer classes and made friendship with the gentleman who was working at the internet cafe in Uganda.</li>
      <li>A few months after i started helping at the internet cafe and took advantage to learn more about typing and internet explore.</li>
      <li>I recently took a moment and thought other wasy i can gain more knowledge about computers and luckily i heard about refcode program.</li>
      <li>In my entire life, i have never though of learning coding becasue i had a lot of friends who are computer science graduates and they have always told me that coding is very difficult.</li>
      <li>Despite all those scary stories from my friends, i decided to explore coding and also i decided to not inform my friends that i am starting to learn about coding.</li>
      </li>Overall, after attending a few sprints i started feeling more confortable and started to actually fall in love with coding.</li>
      </li>From the refcode i was able to write my first code and since then i feel like coding is becoming part of my life. I now spend a lot of time watching videos and reading about coding.</li>
      <li>Also, with the support and help from my tutor Josh and other amazing TAs i am now able to speak a few coding languages.</li>
      </li>Now i can't wait to see what the future holds for me in the coding world!</li>
      <li> I am not done yet with langauge, i am looking foward to learning and become a profesional developer.</li>
